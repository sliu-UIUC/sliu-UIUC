- 👋 Hi, I’m Shiyu Liu. I am an incoming master student in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). 
- 👀 I’m passionate about software development and human-centered design. I'm also interested in data mining and data visualization as I will further explore them during my study at UIUC.
- 🌱 I’m currently a student developer with Android Graphics Tools team under Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program. I provided support for various tools surrounding SPIRV-FUZZ, which are used to explore vulnerabilities of graphics drivers on Android and PC devices through various transformation of inputs.  
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating with top software engineers in the industry in summer next year to gain experience and skills and prepare myself for a fulltime role as a software engineer.
